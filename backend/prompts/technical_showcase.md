# Technical Showcase LinkedIn Post Template

Based on the following GitHub project analysis, write an engaging LinkedIn post:

**Project**: {repo_name}
**Description**: {description}
**Tech Stack**: {tech_stack}
**Key Features**:
{features}

**README Summary**:
{readme_summary}

**File Structure Highlights**:
{file_structure}

---

Write a LinkedIn post (max 3000 characters) in **technical showcase format**:

## PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST:
Before writing, answer these:
1. What technical decision would make another developer say "oh that's clever"?
2. What popular approach did you NOT use, and why?
3. What trade-off did you make that was worth it?

## Structure:
1. **Hook** (1-2 sentences) - Lead with a surprising metric OR "Here's why I didn't use [popular thing]"
2. **The Problem** (2-3 sentences) - What technical challenge did this solve? Be specific
3. **The Approach** (3-5 bullet points) - Key architecture decisions WITH reasoning
4. **The Trade-off** (1-2 sentences) - What did you sacrifice and why it was worth it
5. **The Result** (1-2 sentences) - Concrete outcomes (speed, maintainability, developer experience)
6. **Call to Action** - Invite debate ("Would you have done it differently?")

## Guidelines:
- Be specific about technical decisions (don't just list technologies)
- Explain the "why" behind architecture choices
- Include concrete examples or code patterns
- Balance depth with accessibility for non-experts
- Use technical terms but explain complex concepts briefly
- Include 3-5 relevant technical hashtags
- Link to the GitHub repo (mention it's open source if applicable)
- **IMPORTANT: Do NOT use markdown formatting (no asterisks, no bold, no italics). Write plain text only.**
