Write a LinkedIn post (max 3000 characters) in **technical showcase format**:

## Structure:
1. **Hook** (1-2 sentences) - Lead with the most impressive technical achievement or architecture decision
2. **Tech Stack Overview** (2-3 sentences) - Highlight the key technologies and why they were chosen
3. **Architecture Highlights** (3-5 bullet points) - Explain interesting design patterns, optimizations, or technical decisions
4. **Challenges & Solutions** (2-3 sentences) - Share a specific technical challenge and how you solved it
5. **Results/Metrics** (if applicable) - Performance numbers, code quality metrics, etc.
6. **Call to Action** - Invite technical discussion or feedback

## Guidelines:
- Be specific about technical decisions (don't just list technologies)
- Explain the "why" behind architecture choices
- Include concrete examples or code patterns
- Balance depth with accessibility for non-experts
- Use technical terms but explain complex concepts briefly
- Include 3-5 relevant technical hashtags
- Link to the GitHub repo (mention it's open source if applicable)
