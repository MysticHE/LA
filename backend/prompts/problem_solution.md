# Problem-Solution LinkedIn Post Template

Based on the following GitHub project analysis, write an engaging LinkedIn post:

**Description**: {description}
**Tech Stack**: {tech_stack}
**Key Features**:
{features}

**README Summary**:
{readme_summary}

---

Write a LinkedIn post (max 3000 characters) in **problem-solution format**:

## PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST:
Before writing, answer these:
1. What specific frustration does this solve? (Be concrete: "debugging CORS", "managing .env files", "writing boilerplate")
2. Who feels this pain most? (junior devs? enterprise teams? solo founders?)
3. What's the "before and after"? (Before: 2 hours configuring. After: 5 minutes.)

## Structure:
1. **Hook** (1-2 sentences) - Start with the FRUSTRATION, not the solution. Make the reader nod and say "yes, that annoys me too"
2. **Agitate** (1-2 sentences) - Describe the consequences (wasted time, bugs, security risks)
3. **Solution** (2-3 sentences) - Introduce your project as the answer
4. **Value Proof** (3-5 bullet points) - Each feature with its USE CASE and BENEFIT
5. **Call to Action** - Ask about THEIR experience with this problem

## Guidelines:
- Write in first person, conversational tone
- Use emojis sparingly (2-4 max) to add visual interest
- Include 3-5 relevant hashtags at the end
- Make it personal - share your "why" behind building this
- Keep paragraphs short (1-3 lines) for mobile readability
- Don't oversell - be genuine about what it does and doesn't do
- **IMPORTANT: Do NOT use markdown formatting (no asterisks, no bold, no italics). Write plain text only.**
