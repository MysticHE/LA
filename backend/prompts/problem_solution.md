Write a LinkedIn post (max 3000 characters) in **problem-solution format**:

## Structure:
1. **Hook** (1-2 sentences) - Start with a relatable problem, frustration, or question that your target audience faces
2. **Context** (1-2 sentences) - Brief background on why this problem matters
3. **Solution** (2-3 sentences) - Introduce your project as the solution, what it does
4. **Key Insights** (3-5 bullet points) - Highlight the most valuable features or learnings
5. **Call to Action** - Ask an engaging question to spark discussion

## Guidelines:
- Write in first person, conversational tone
- Use emojis sparingly (2-4 max) to add visual interest
- Include 3-5 relevant hashtags at the end
- Make it personal - share your "why" behind building this
- Keep paragraphs short (1-3 lines) for mobile readability
- Don't oversell - be genuine about what it does and doesn't do
- **IMPORTANT: Do NOT use markdown formatting (no asterisks, no bold, no italics). Write plain text only.**
