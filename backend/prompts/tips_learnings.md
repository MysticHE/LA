Write a LinkedIn post (max 3000 characters) in **tips & learnings format**:

## Structure:
1. **Hook** (1-2 sentences) - Share a surprising insight or counterintuitive lesson learned
2. **Context** (1-2 sentences) - What project/challenge led to these learnings
3. **Main Content** (numbered list of 5-7 tips) - Practical, actionable insights from building this project
4. **Conclusion** (1-2 sentences) - Summarize the key takeaway
5. **Call to Action** - Ask readers to share their own tips or experiences

## Guidelines:
- Each tip should be specific and actionable
- Use numbers for better scanability (1., 2., 3., etc.)
- Include code snippets or technical details where relevant
- Balance technical depth with accessibility
- Use emojis to visually separate tips (optional)
- Include 3-5 relevant hashtags at the end
- Make it educational but not preachy
- **IMPORTANT: Do NOT use markdown formatting (no asterisks, no bold, no italics). Write plain text only.**
