Write a LinkedIn post (max 3000 characters) in **tips & learnings format**:

## PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST:
Before writing, answer these:
1. What SURPRISED you while building this? What assumption was wrong?
2. What would you tell your past self before starting?
3. What's the one thing that made the biggest difference?

## Structure:
1. **Hook** (1-2 sentences) - Start with a counterintuitive insight or "I was wrong about..." statement
2. **Context** (1-2 sentences) - What project/challenge led to these learnings
3. **Main Content** (numbered list of 3-5 tips) - Each tip structured as:
   - The mistake/assumption I made
   - What I learned
   - What you should do instead
4. **Takeaway** (1-2 sentences) - The one thing to remember
5. **Call to Action** - "What's the most surprising thing you learned building [related topic]?"

## Guidelines:
- Each tip should be specific and actionable
- Use numbers for better scanability (1., 2., 3., etc.)
- Include code snippets or technical details where relevant
- Balance technical depth with accessibility
- Use emojis to visually separate tips (optional)
- Include 3-5 relevant hashtags at the end
- Make it educational but not preachy
- **IMPORTANT: Do NOT use markdown formatting (no asterisks, no bold, no italics). Write plain text only.**
