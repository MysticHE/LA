### Story: US-001 - Create Content Analyzer Service
**Status: PASSED**

#### Changes Made:
1. Created `backend/src/models/image_schemas.py`:
   - ContentAnalysis Pydantic model with themes, technologies, sentiment, keywords, suggested_visual_elements
   - Sentiment enum with POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, NEGATIVE, INSPIRATIONAL, INFORMATIVE values

2. Created `backend/src/analyzers/content_analyzer.py`:
   - ContentAnalyzer class with analyze() method
   - Technology detection for 50+ technologies (Python, FastAPI, React, AWS, etc.)
   - Theme detection for 17 categories (machine learning, web development, devops, etc.)
   - Sentiment analysis based on word patterns
   - Visual element suggestion based on detected themes

3. Created `backend/tests/test_content_analyzer.py`:
   - 35 comprehensive unit tests covering all acceptance criteria
   - Tests for technology detection, theme extraction, sentiment analysis
   - Edge cases: empty content, special characters (C#, .NET), Go vs "go to"

#### Test Results:
- All 35 test_content_analyzer.py tests pass
- Full backend test suite: 503 tests pass

#### Notes:
- Fixed C# detection by using `c#` pattern without word boundary (# is not a word char)
- Fixed escape sequence warnings by using plain strings instead of raw strings for hyphenated words
- Used re.escape() when building patterns from INSPIRATIONAL_WORDS and INFORMATIVE_WORDS
